**MealGenie Test Data Strategies:**

**Realistic Recipe Test Data:**
- Factory-generated recipes with varied complexity (simple to gourmet)
- Ingredient combinations representing different cuisines and dietary needs
- Recipe fixtures with proper image paths, cooking times, and serving sizes
- Nutritional data that reflects real-world recipe complexity
- Recipe history data for versioning and modification tracking

**Meal Planning Test Scenarios:**
- Weekly meal plans with balanced nutrition and variety
- Dietary restriction combinations (vegan + gluten-free + low-sodium)
- Time-constrained meal plans (quick weeknight dinners, weekend cooking)
- Seasonal recipe availability and ingredient freshness
- Budget-conscious meal planning with cost considerations

**Shopping List Test Data:**
- Ingredient aggregation across multiple recipes with unit conversions
- Shopping list categorization matching real grocery store layouts
- Quantity rounding and packaging size considerations
- Cross-recipe ingredient optimization and waste reduction

**UI Interaction Test Patterns:**
- Recipe browsing with progressive loading and infinite scroll
- Search and filter combinations with real-time results
- Drag-and-drop interactions with visual feedback and validation
- Form input parsing with natural language ingredient descriptions
- Image upload and thumbnail generation workflows

**MealGenie-Specific Edge Cases:**

**Recipe Domain Complexity:**
- Recipe scaling with non-linear ingredient relationships (spices, leavening agents)
- Fractional ingredient handling and measurement precision
- Recipe instructions with temperature and timing dependencies
- Multi-step recipes with intermediate ingredient preparations
- Recipe modifications that affect nutritional calculations

**Meal Planning Edge Cases:**
- Dietary restriction conflicts requiring ingredient substitutions
- Weekly meal plans with insufficient nutritional balance
- Recipe availability conflicts (seasonal ingredients, dietary changes)
- Shopping list generation from overlapping meal plan periods
- Meal plan persistence across application updates and data migrations

**UI Responsiveness Edge Cases:**
- Large recipe collections (1000+ recipes) browsing performance
- Real-time search with complex filter combinations
- Drag-and-drop operations with validation failures
- Image loading failures and fallback display strategies
- Form validation with complex ingredient parsing edge cases

**Integration Testing Workflows:**

**Complete Recipe Management Workflow:**
```python
def test_complete_recipe_creation_to_meal_planning_workflow():
    # Create recipe → Add to meal plan → Generate shopping list
    # Validate data flow through all architectural layers
```

**End-to-End Meal Planning Workflow:**
```python
def test_meal_planning_workflow_with_dietary_restrictions():
    # Plan meals → Validate restrictions → Generate shopping list → Track nutrition
```

**Architecture Boundary Testing:**
```python
def test_ui_layer_never_imports_core_services_directly():
    # Validate import boundaries across the application
    
def test_viewmodels_properly_coordinate_with_services():
    # Ensure proper MVVM pattern implementation
    
def test_repositories_return_dtos_not_models():
    # Validate proper data transfer layer implementation
```

**Performance and Load Testing:**

**Recipe Search Performance:**
- Search response times with large recipe databases
- Filter combination performance with multiple criteria
- Progressive loading efficiency for recipe browsing

**UI Responsiveness:**
- Recipe card rendering performance in grid layouts
- Image loading and thumbnail generation timing
- Drag-and-drop interaction responsiveness

**Data Processing Performance:**
- Shopping list generation time for complex meal plans
- Nutritional calculation speed for recipe modifications
- Meal plan validation performance with multiple dietary restrictions

**Testing Tools and Patterns:**

**MealGenie Testing Infrastructure:**
- pytest markers for different test categories (@pytest.mark.unit, @pytest.mark.integration, @pytest.mark.ui)
- factory-boy factories for recipe, ingredient, and meal plan test data
- pytest-qt fixtures for UI component testing (qtbot, qapp)
- Database session fixtures with automatic rollback for isolated tests
- Mock services and repositories for unit testing isolation

**Recipe Domain Test Utilities:**
- Recipe validation helpers for common assertion patterns
- Ingredient parsing test utilities for natural language input
- Nutritional calculation verification helpers
- Meal plan generation test utilities
- Shopping list validation and comparison helpers

**Success Metrics for MealGenie Testing:**
- Comprehensive test coverage across all architectural layers
- Reliable recipe management workflows under various conditions
- Performance validation for recipe browsing and meal planning
- Proper separation of concerns validated through architecture tests
- User workflow reliability from recipe creation to shopping list generation

Focus on testing the complex business rules, architectural boundaries, and user workflows that make MealGenie's recipe management both reliable and user-friendly while maintaining clean MVVM architecture.
