    def __init__(self, page_size=50, cache_size=200):
        self.page_size = page_size
        self.cache = LRUCache(cache_size)
        self.image_cache = ImageCache(max_size_mb=50)
    
    def load_recipe_page(self, offset: int) -> List[RecipeDTO]:
        # Efficient paginated loading with caching
        cache_key = f"recipes_page_{offset}"
        if cache_key in self.cache:
            return self.cache[cache_key]
        
        # Load with optimized query and minimal data
        recipes = self.repository.get_recipes_page(
            offset=offset, 
            limit=self.page_size,
            include_ingredients=False  # Load separately when needed
        )
        
        self.cache[cache_key] = recipes
        return recipes
```

**10. UI Thread Management**
```python
# Background recipe processing
class RecipeProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.thread_pool = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3)
    
    async def process_recipe_search(self, filters: RecipeFilters):
        # Move heavy search to background
        loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
        return await loop.run_in_executor(
            self.thread_pool, 
            self._perform_search, 
            filters
        )
    
    def _perform_search(self, filters: RecipeFilters) -> List[RecipeDTO]:
        # Heavy database query processing
        return self.recipe_service.search_recipes(filters)
```

**11. Database Connection Optimization**

**Performance Testing Strategies:**

**12. Recipe Performance Test Scenarios**
```python
# Load testing for recipe search
def test_recipe_search_performance():
    # Test with 10,000+ recipes
    start_time = time.time()
    results = recipe_service.search_recipes(
        ingredients=['chicken', 'rice'],
        dietary_restrictions=['gluten-free'],
        max_prep_time=30
    )
    search_time = time.time() - start_time
    assert search_time < 0.2  # 200ms target
    assert len(results) > 0

# Memory usage testing
def test_recipe_browsing_memory():
    initial_memory = get_memory_usage()
    
    # Load 500 recipe cards
    for i in range(500):
        recipe_card = RecipeCard(recipe_data[i])
        recipe_grid.add_widget(recipe_card)
    
    final_memory = get_memory_usage()
    memory_increase = final_memory - initial_memory
    assert memory_increase < 100  # Less than 100MB
```

- **Solution**: Implement virtual scrolling and progressive loading
- **Implementation**: Recipe card virtualization and efficient widget management

**Memory Issues with Large Recipe Collections:**
- **Root Cause**: All recipe data loaded into memory simultaneously
- **Solution**: Implement intelligent caching with LRU eviction
- **Implementation**: Multi-level cache with recipe metadata and image separation

**15. Scaling Strategy for Recipe Growth**
