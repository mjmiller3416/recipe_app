# UI Consistency Check: $ARGUMENTS

Please analyze $ARGUMENTS for UI consistency and best practices:

## UI Component Structure Analysis

### 1. Component Organization
- Proper separation of concerns within UI components
- Consistent file and class naming conventions
- Appropriate component size and complexity
- Clear component responsibilities

### 2. State Management
- Proper use of view models vs direct state manipulation
- Consistent patterns for handling user input
- Appropriate separation between UI state and business data
- Error state handling consistency

### 3. Styling Consistency
- Consistent use of theme system
- Proper separation of styling concerns
- Reuse of common styling patterns
- Appropriate use of style constants vs hardcoded values

### 4. Common UI Patterns
- Consistent error message display
- Uniform loading states and indicators
- Standardized user feedback patterns
- Consistent navigation patterns

### 5. Component Reusability
- Opportunities for component abstraction
- Proper use of existing composite components
- Identification of repeated UI patterns
- Suggestions for new reusable components

## UI Architecture Patterns

### 6. View Model Usage
- Proper separation between view logic and presentation
- Consistent view model patterns
- Appropriate data binding approaches
- State management best practices

### 7. Dialog and Navigation Management
- Consistent use of dialog managers
- Proper navigation flow patterns
- Appropriate use of navigation managers
- Error handling in navigation flows

## Output Format
Provide:
1. **Consistency issues**: Deviations from established patterns
2. **Improvement suggestions**: Specific recommendations for better consistency
3. **Reusability opportunities**: Code that could be abstracted into reusable components
4. **Best practices**: Recommendations aligned with your UI architecture
5. **Priority fixes**: Most important consistency issues to address first
