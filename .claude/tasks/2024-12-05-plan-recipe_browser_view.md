3. Domain coordinators must exist before main view refactoring
4. ViewModel enhancement must precede view refactoring
5. Integration testing validates all manager coordination
6. Architecture compliance validation ensures MVVM boundaries

**Parallel Work Opportunities**:
- Tasks 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 can be done in parallel (no dependencies)
- Tasks 2.1 and 2.2 can be done in parallel after Task 1.3
- Unit tests can be developed alongside each component

## Expected Outcomes

### Maintainability Improvements
- **Code Reduction**: Main view class from 774 lines to ~150 lines
- **Single Responsibility**: Each manager handles one specific concern
- **Independent Testing**: Each component can be unit tested in isolation
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Developers can focus on specific areas

### Reusability Gains
- **Generic Managers**: PerformanceManager and EventCoordinator available for other views
- **Pattern Consistency**: Established patterns for performance optimization
- **Reduced Duplication**: Common patterns centralized in managers

### Development Velocity
- **Isolated Changes**: Modifications don't affect unrelated functionality
- **Easier Debugging**: Clear separation of concerns aids troubleshooting
- **Reduced Integration Risk**: Well-defined manager interfaces

### Architecture Compliance
- **Full MVVM Compliance**: Clear separation between View, ViewModel, and Model layers
