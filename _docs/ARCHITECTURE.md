## Key Architectural Principles

### Dependency Flow

```
UI Layer ‚Üí Core Layer ‚Üê Style Layer
    ‚Üì         ‚Üì
  Utils ‚Üê Shared Utils
```

### Layer Boundaries & Import Rules

**Strict dependency flow ensures maintainability and testability**

- **UI ‚Üí Core**: UI layer imports from Core for business logic access
- **Core ‚Üê UI**: Core layer never imports from UI (maintains framework independence)
- **Style ‚Üî UI**: Style layer integrates with UI for presentation concerns
- **Utils**: Accessible by all layers for shared functionality
- **Config**: Available to all layers for configuration management
- **Assets**: Accessible primarily by UI and Style layers

### Domain Entities & Business Objects

**Core business entities representing the meal planning domain**

- **Recipe** - Central entity with ingredients, instructions, metadata, and image management
- **Ingredient** - Master ingredient catalog with nutritional information and categorization
- **RecipeIngredient** - Junction entity managing ingredient quantities and recipe relationships
- **MealSelection** - Meal planning entries with scheduling and portion management
- **ShoppingItem** - Shopping list items with categorization and completion tracking
- **RecipeHistory** - Recipe usage tracking and analytics
- **SavedMealState** & **ShoppingState** - Application state persistence entities

## UI Architecture & Design Patterns

**Modern desktop application interface with clean architectural boundaries**

- **Window Management** - Custom title bar and window controls for consistent cross-platform experience
- **Component-Based Design** - Modular, reusable UI components with clear hierarchical organization
- **MVVM Pattern** - Strict separation of concerns with ViewModels mediating between Views and Services
- **Navigation System** - Centralized routing with view registry and navigation history management
- **Progressive Rendering** - Optimized performance for large datasets (recipe browsing with card pooling)
- **Material Design Integration** - Custom theming system with QSS stylesheets and dynamic color schemes
- **Responsive Layout** - Adaptive interfaces that work across different window sizes and orientations

## Architecture Benefits

This layered architecture ensures:

- **Maintainability** - Clear separation of concerns with well-defined boundaries
- **Testability** - Each layer can be tested independently with appropriate mocking
- **Scalability** - Modular design supports feature expansion without architectural debt
- **Framework Independence** - Core business logic remains decoupled from UI framework
- **Performance** - Optimized data access patterns and UI rendering strategies

The architecture successfully supports MealGenie's comprehensive feature set including recipe management, meal planning, shopping list generation, and AI-powered recipe assistance.
