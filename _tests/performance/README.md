## 🔧 Configuration and Customization

### Performance Thresholds

Thresholds are defined in the test files and can be customized:

```python
# Core requirements (strict)
RECIPE_LOADING_THRESHOLD_MS = 200
FILTER_OPERATION_THRESHOLD_MS = 100
COORDINATOR_COMMUNICATION_THRESHOLD_MS = 10

# Efficiency requirements  
MIN_CACHE_HIT_RATE_PERCENT = 30
MIN_POOL_HIT_RATE_PERCENT = 20
MAX_MEMORY_GROWTH_MB = 20
```

### Test Data Configuration

Test data can be customized for different scenarios:

```python
# Standard test dataset (11 recipes for baseline)
STANDARD_RECIPE_COUNT = 11

# Stress test dataset (larger datasets)
STRESS_TEST_RECIPE_COUNT = 200

# Recipe complexity levels
RECIPE_COMPLEXITY = ["simple", "medium", "complex"]
```

### Custom Benchmarks

Add custom benchmarks by extending the benchmark classes:

```python
class TestCustomPerformanceBenchmarks:
    def test_custom_operation_benchmark(self, benchmark_runner):
        with benchmark_runner.benchmark_operation("CustomCoordinator", "custom_operation", 50):
            # Your custom performance test
            pass
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### High Memory Usage
```bash
# Run memory-focused tests
pytest _tests/performance/ -k "memory" -v

# Check for memory leaks
pytest _tests/performance/performance_regression_tests.py::TestMemoryRegressionTesting::test_memory_leak_regression -v
```

#### Slow Performance
```bash
# Identify bottlenecks
pytest _tests/performance/coordinator_performance_benchmarks.py -v

# Run stress tests
pytest _tests/performance/ -m "slow" -v
```

#### Regression Failures
```bash
# Check regression details
pytest _tests/performance/performance_regression_tests.py::TestComprehensiveRegressionAnalysis -v

# Establish new baselines if needed
python _tests/performance/run_performance_validation.py --baseline
```

### Performance Debugging

Enable detailed logging for performance debugging:

```python
# In test files
DebugLogger.log("Custom performance debug info", "debug")

# Or set environment variable
export PERFORMANCE_DEBUG=1
```

## 📚 Advanced Usage

### Custom Performance Profiles

Create custom performance profiles for different environments:

```python
# Development profile (relaxed thresholds)
DEV_PROFILE = {
    "recipe_loading_ms": 300,
    "filter_operation_ms": 150,
    "acceptable_regression": 30.0
}

# Production profile (strict thresholds)
PROD_PROFILE = {
    "recipe_loading_ms": 150,
    "filter_operation_ms": 75, 
    "acceptable_regression": 15.0
}
```

### Continuous Performance Monitoring

Set up continuous monitoring:

```bash
# Daily performance validation
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/recipe_app && python _tests/performance/run_performance_validation.py --regression --compare >> performance.log 2>&1
```

### Performance Data Analysis

Analyze historical performance data:

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

# Load historical results
results_files = sorted(Path(".").glob("performance_validation_results_*.json"))
for result_file in results_files[-10:]:  # Last 10 runs
    with open(result_file) as f:
        data = json.load(f)
        print(f"{result_file.name}: {data['summary']['overall_status']}")
```

## 🎯 Performance Optimization Guide

### Identified Optimizations

Based on performance validation, these optimizations have been implemented:

1. **Object Pooling**: Recipe card reuse reduces memory allocation
2. **Progressive Rendering**: Large datasets rendered in batches
3. **Intelligent Caching**: Filter results cached for repeated access
4. **Debounced Operations**: Rapid filter changes batched efficiently
5. **Coordinator Architecture**: Separation of concerns improves maintainability

### Future Optimizations

Areas for future performance improvement:

- **Virtual Scrolling**: For very large recipe datasets (500+)
- **Image Lazy Loading**: Defer recipe image loading until visible
- **Background Processing**: Move heavy operations to background threads
- **Database Query Optimization**: Optimize recipe queries for common filters
- **Memory Pool Tuning**: Dynamic pool sizing based on usage patterns
