‚úÖ What to do next (and how to fix this without losing control)
Here‚Äôs a step-by-step plan tailored to your exact case:

‚úÇÔ∏è Step 1 ‚Äî Leave application.qss fully separate
Treat it as a base/global stylesheet, and don‚Äôt include it in any per-view QSS.

In ThemeController.apply_theme(), you already do:

python
Copy
Edit
qss = self.loader.load(QssPaths.BASE) + self.loader.load(view_qss_path)
‚úÖ Change QssPaths.BASE to QssPaths.APPLICATION
‚úÖ That makes sure application-wide styles are always loaded first, then view-specific styles override as needed

üßº Step 2 ‚Äî Remove app-level styling from views
This means:

No #TitleBar, #SidebarWidget, #ApplicationWrapper, or #SearchWidget inside add_recipes.qss, etc.

Keep only styles for widgets owned by the view (like #AddRecipes, #IngredientWidget, #cb_recipe_category, etc.)

If you still need those widgets styled in a custom way per view, you can override selectively with new rules (but not duplicate the base rules!)

üß© Step 3 ‚Äî Extract shared widget styles
Pull common widget-specific styling (like #DialogWidget, #IngredientWidget, etc.) into their own QSS files:

ingredient_widget.qss

message_dialog.qss

recipe_card.qss

Then define a mapping in something like a future QssCombiner.get_for_view(view_name) that knows what to load.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
return [QssPaths.APPLICATION, QssPaths.Views.ADD_RECIPES, QssPaths.Components.MESSAGE_DIALOG, QssPaths.Components.INGREDIENT_WIDGET]
üí° Step 4 ‚Äî View QSS should only cover view content
No global font, no app-wide spacing. Just:

Main container for the view (#AddRecipes)

Child widgets specific to this view (#IngredientWidget, etc.)

Visual overrides that shouldn‚Äôt affect other screens

üß† Final Summary:
Layer	File	When it loads	What it should include
Global	application.qss	Always	Wrapper, titlebar, sidebar, global fonts, search bar
View	add_recipes.qss, dashboard.qss, etc.	Per view	Main layout, layout-specific QLineEdit, QComboBox
Component	message_dialog.qss, ingredient_widget.qss	Shared	Self-contained widget styles
